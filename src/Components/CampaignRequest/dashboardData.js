      desc: `Each MICROBLADE PILL XL™ comes with a super-fast attaching/detaching carabiner ring to ease your everyday carry. The carabiner ring also gives you a good, secure grip when using the blade and enables full control of the edge positioning. 
      We don't want to bulk up your pockets. Microblade Pill XL is so small and light you can barely feel it in your pocket. In our busy lifestyle convenience is everything. Take it with you wherever you go. Attach it to your keys, or backpack, or carry it in your coin pocket. 
      The pill is sharp but safe to touch at the same time so that consumers can not accidentally slice their fingers. The tip on the other hand is very sharp and could easily pierce something if force is applied. For safety reasons, cap locking has been slightly adjusted - tightened if you compare it to the original Microblade Pill. 
      It's a super convenient spring-loaded-ball locking mechanism that works flawlessly and eases usage. Simply pull it off, do the task, and put it back on. It can't be more convenient than that. `,

      The outdoors as much as urban lifestyle gave us the idea to start drawing out a new type of multitool carabiner which could combine the function of key holder, multitool and self-defense tool together. It could nearly handle all your everyday task. 
      With it, equip yourself, to create the exact utilities you need. `,

      The Magic Dry Pocket™ triple locking mechanism pocket is completely reengineered to be three times thinner than our first Kickstarter, and with an improved waterproof rating, certified to IPX8, 300m/1000ft, (an industry first) you can literally go scuba diving and no water will enter the pocket. 
      Now the flap over the mag seal is secured by a our signature logo snap button for more security in demanding situations. 
      And I did send my iphone down to 300M to test it. I thought, ‘This would be great if your thing is to record whale songs. You could do it right on your phone.’`,

      Why are bartenders using spherical balls of ice in drinks nowadays? Is it just to impress you with fancy skills?  Most people have to settle for cube ice or crushed ice for a cold drink when serving themselves, since making ice balls at home is difficult and time-consuming. 
      Spherical ice is not used just to impress you. A spherical ice ball melts slower than typical cube ice, chills the drink faster, and won’t dilute the liquor, thereby keeping the flavor.  That’s why the drinks always taste better in the bar than in your home. `,
